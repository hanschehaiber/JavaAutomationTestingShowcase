# Automation Testing Framework Showcase


Welcome to my Automation Testing Framework Showcase repository! 
This repository serves as a demonstration and reference for building a robust automation testing framework using Java, Selenium, RestAssured, TestNG, and WireMock.

## Key Technologies
  **Java**: The programming language used to develop the automation scripts.  
  **Selenium**: A powerful web application testing framework for automating browser actions.  
  **RestAssured**: A Java library for simplifying HTTP request/response handling and validation in API testing.  
  **TestNG**: A testing framework inspired by JUnit and NUnit but designed to be more powerful and easier to use.  
  **WireMock**: A library for stubbing and mocking HTTP-based services for effective API testing.  

## Project Structure
- UI Automation Testing Framework:
``` src/main/java/com/saucedemo ``` 

- API Testing Framework (WIP):
``` src/test/java/api ```
